 <h2>Installation instructions</h2>
 
 <div>
 This project is managed using maven2. It depends on two other projects: spf-bindings and spf-api. So you need
 to install this projects first (suggested install sequence as above).<br/><br/>
 </div>
 <div>
 There are some third party libraries needed to run the SPFramework which are not included in the release and source repository
 due to licensing issues. Please download them manually and copy the corresponding .jar file to the lib-repository/ directory.<br/><br/>
 </div>
 <div>
 The following table contains a column for developers. As this project is maintained using maven some desired third party
 libraries (due to licensing issues) need to be added manually.
 The column contains the groupID, artifact and the name to be applied to the .jar file. Please drop the renamed .jar file in the designated subfolder of the "lib-repository"" directory.
 Afterwards, a common maven command (e.g "mvn install") builds the project.
