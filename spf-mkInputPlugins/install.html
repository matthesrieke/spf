 <h2>Installation instructions</h2>
 
 <div>
 This project is managed using maven2.<br/><br/>
 </div>
 <div>
 There are some third party libraries needed to run this plugin which are not included in the release and source repository
 due to licensing issues. Please download them manually and copy the corresponding .jar file to the lib-repository/ directory.<br/><br/>
 </div>
 <div>
 The following table contains a column for developers. As this project is maintained using maven some desired third party
 libraries (due to licensing issues) need to be added manually. If you already have installed spf-core succesfully you may skip the next steps.
 The column contains the groupID, artifact and the name to be applied to the .jar file. Please drop the renamed .jar file in the designated subfolder of the "lib-repository"" directory.
 Afterwards, a common maven command (e.g "mvn install") builds the project.
